# FacebookPagesUnlikeJSScript

A Javascript code to run in browser console to unlike all Facebook pages that you liked before

## Where to find the pages you liked before

* Go to your Facebook profile.
* Click on the three dots at the top right under your profile picture.
* Click on "Activity Log".
* Find "Pages, page likes and interests".
* Now you have reached the page with all the liked pages.

## How To Run The Script

* Open Developer Tools by: Pressing ```F12``` or right click anywhere on the page then choose the last option "Inspect".
* Go To Console Tab.
* Copy the script from the [main.js](main.js) file and Paste it to the Console Tab in Developer Tools.
* Hit ```Enter``` and the script will now select all pages and click on ```Remove``` button then click again on the popup ```Remove``` button, **NOTE: another popup will appear once or twice requiring you account password (its a Facebook security feature) hit ```Confirm``` manually**

## What to expect

The script will select all appeared pages in the current view then click on Remove button and confirm removing, then scroll down to load new content and do all again until "Nothing to show" message appear, and that's it, I have tried it on my 5500 liked pages, so it will work for you
